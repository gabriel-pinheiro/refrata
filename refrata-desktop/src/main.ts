/**
 * Refrata Desktop's main process: the Node side of the Electron app. It owns
 * what a web page cannot: the runtime child process, windows, native dialogs
 * and the app's life cycle. Each concern has its own file; this one is the
 * order things happen in.
 *
 *   launch → single-instance lock → what to start with (`start-up-mode.ts`)
 *     a file, or local last time → fork the runtime → wait for /health
 *                                  → connect as a client → Studio window,
 *                                  unless started without it (`--no-studio`)
 *     remote last time           → ask its /health → connect → its Studio
 *     first launch, or a failure → the launch page, which starts one of those
 *   quit   → unsaved changes? → Outputs delivering? → windows close
 *          → runtime stops → exit
 *
 * `desktop-modes.ts` holds the moves between those; File ▸ Connect to... opens
 * the launch page again, over the session. `application-menu.ts` is the native
 * menu bar, which in Desktop shows Studio's own File and Edit items.
