/**
 * The preload script: the one piece of Desktop that runs inside the Studio
 * window. It runs before the page, in a context of its own
 * (`contextIsolation`), without Node (`sandbox`), and hands the page a few
 * functions through `contextBridge`. The page never sees `ipcRenderer`: each
 * function sends one fixed message, so a page can ask for a file picker and
 * nothing else.
 *
 * This is the preload for the runtime on this computer, so it hands out two
 * bridges: `window.refrataMenu` (the native menu; every Studio window has
 * it, see `menu-expose.ts`) and `window.refrataDesktop` below.
 *
 * A sandboxed preload cannot `import` other files at run time, so
 * `scripts/build.mjs` bundles this one into a single CommonJS file.
