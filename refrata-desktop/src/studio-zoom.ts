 * Studio's zoom, one setting for every Studio window: kept in Desktop's state
 * file and put on each Studio window Desktop opens, local or elsewhere, so a
 * runtime elsewhere shows at the same zoom as this computer's.
 *
 * Chromium keeps a zoom level per host and shares it between the pages of
 * that host, which would zoom every page of a runtime with its Studio and
 * give a runtime elsewhere a level of its own. A Studio window's zoom is its
 * own instead (`zoomMode: "isolated"`, which lasts across its navigations),
 * and another of the runtime's pages opened in a window of its own cannot
 * zoom at all (`"disabled"`). The launch page stays at 100% too.
