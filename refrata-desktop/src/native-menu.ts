 * keys still undo typing, which Chromium does without a menu on Windows and
 * Linux (for macOS see `pageCommand` in `application-menu.ts`). The launch
 * window has no page items, so it gets those roles for its address field.
 *
 * Windows and Linux have no Close Window item: closing the Studio window quits
 * Desktop and stops the runtime on this computer, too much for a casual
 * Ctrl+W. macOS keeps its conventions: the application menu first, with Quit
 * in it, Close Window in File, and a Window menu.
 *
 * Zoom and Developer Tools are not roles, because a role acts on whichever
 * window is focused and macOS has one menu for every window: the actions act
 * on a Studio or launch window only, never on another page's.
