/**
 * Opens a session's Studio window, or returns the one that is open, and

 *
 * Usually closing Studio is quitting: without that window Desktop has nothing
 * to show for itself, on macOS too. So the close is turned into a quit, the
 * quit asks its questions (`quit-gate.ts`), and only an agreed quit closes
 * the window.
 *
 * A session started without the Studio window is the exception. There the
 * window is a visit: someone started Refrata again on the mini-PC to look,
 * and closing it leaves everything running as it was before, so nothing is
 * asked. Quitting is File ▸ Quit.
